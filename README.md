# Conti Ransomware Leak Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the **Conti ransomware gang leaks**. The leaks, which occurred in early 2022, exposed critical internal communications and operational details of the notorious ransomware group. The analysis combines **sentiment analysis**, **network analysis**, and **data visualization** to uncover insights into the group's structure, communication patterns, and sentiment trends.

## Project Overview

The leaked data from the Conti ransomware group provides a unique opportunity to understand how such cybercriminal organizations operate. This project focuses on analyzing the leaked communications to:

1. **Perform sentiment analysis** on the conversations to infer the mood and tone of the group members.
2. **Analyze network structure** to understand the hierarchy and interactions within the group.
3. **Visualize trends** in the data, such as spikes in activity or changes in sentiment over time.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses the **VADER Sentiment Analysis** tool to categorize the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of communications.
- **Network Analysis**: Implements **NetworkX** to visualize and study the connections between individuals in the group.
- **Data Manipulation and Visualization**: Utilizes **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for handling and visualizing data.
- **Insights**: Highlights key findings from the data, such as patterns in communication or anomalies in sentiment.
